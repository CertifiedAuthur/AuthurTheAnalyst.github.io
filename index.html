						<h1>A Data Analyst Portfolio<br />
						</h1>
						<p>Hello, I'm Okafor Chibuzor Authur.

							I hail from the vibrant state of Anambra, Nigeria, and I'm on a mission to unlock the potential of data. By day, I'm a dedicated data analyst, and by night, a relentless problem solver.
							
							My academic journey took me to the esteemed halls of Nnamdi Azikiwe University Awka, where I spent 5 years studying the intricacies of soil science. It was during my final year project that I embarked on a data-driven adventure. I conducted a deep dive into the world of agro waste and single super-phosphate fertilizer, analyzing their impact on soil chemical properties with tomato as my test crop. This experience ignited my passion for data analysis.
							
							In the pursuit of refining my skills, I ventured into the bustling world of hospitality, where I spent four years. The industry taught me invaluable soft skillsâ€”teamwork, effective communication, timeliness, and unwavering attention to detail. These skills have seamlessly complemented my data analysis journey.
							
							Fueling my data-driven quest further, I completed the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate on Coursera, consisting of 8 comprehensive courses. This certification opened doors to proficiency in SQL, R Programming, Excel, and Tableau, the very tools that power my data adventures.
							
							Throughout my journey, I've woven my skills into captivating projects (as you're going to see below), each a testament to my commitment to turning data into actionable insights. 
							
							My work is a reflection of my integrity, the essence of my being. My word is my bond, my work is my signature, and I approach every task with an open heart, ready to make a meaningful impact.
							
							Above all, I find joy in helping others, whether through my analytical prowess or by being a friend. The essence of who I am is intertwined with the idea that my journey is not just mine but a shared experience with every person I meet.
							
							Let's embark on this data-driven journey together.<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/okafor-chibuzor-17832a225/">        Okafor Chibuzor</a>.</p>

									<p>Susan and Tim want to buy a car, but as usual, they have three options, making it difficult to select one because they love all three cars. Susan has enough money to buy any car of her choice, while Tim is going to borrow 40% of the cost of the car to purchase it. As always, they need to make a cost-effective decision.

									<p>
										This project focuses on developing and comparing two image classification models using Keras for the specific task of identifying cracks in concrete surfaces. The dataset [https://s3-api.us-geo.objectstorage.softlayer.net/cf-courses-data/CognitiveClass/DL0321EN/data/concrete_data_week4.zip](Click here to Download) consists of images of concrete, where the objective is to classify each image as either positive (cracked) or negative (not cracked).

										The first model utilizes the VGG16 pre-trained model, which has been pre-trained on large-scale image datasets. The second model is was loaded as it has been built in a previous project, RESNET50 is known for its depth and effectiveness in feature extraction.

										Both models are trained and fine-tuned using the concrete image dataset, with the aim of accurately distinguishing between cracked and non-cracked concrete surfaces. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are employed to assess the performance of each model.

										By comparing the performance of the VGG16 and RESNET50 models, this project aims to determine which architecture is more effective for the task of concrete crack detection. The insights gained from this comparative analysis can inform future efforts in developing image classification systems for detecting cracks in concrete structures.</p>
