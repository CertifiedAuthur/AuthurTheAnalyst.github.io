						<h1>A Data Scientist Portfolio<br />
						</h1>
						<p>I am Okafor Chibuzor Authur, hailing from the vibrant state of Anambra, Nigeria. My mission? To unlock the immense potential of data. By day, I don the hat of a dedicated data scientist, and when the moon rises, I transform into a relentless problem solver.

							My academic journey led me to the esteemed halls of Nnamdi Azikiwe University Awka, where I spent five years immersed in the intricacies of soil science. During my final year project, I embarked on a data-driven adventure, diving deep into the world of agro waste and single super-phosphate fertilizer. My focus? Analyzing their impact on soil chemical properties, with tomatoes as my test crop. This experience ignited my fervor for data analysis.
							
							Venturing beyond academia, I stepped into the bustling world of hospitality, dedicating four years to this dynamic industry. There, I honed invaluable soft skills—teamwork, effective communication, timeliness, and unwavering attention to detail—all seamlessly complementing my data analysis journey.
							
							Fueling my data-driven quest, I proudly hold the following Professional Certificates: Google Data Analytics, Google Advanced Data Analytics, and IBM AI Engineering. These certifications have opened doors to proficiency in an array of tools and techniques, including SQL, R Programming, Excel, Tableau, Python, Advanced Statistics, Regression Analysis, A/B Testing, Computer Vision, Image Processing, and Deep Learning Libraries (such as Keras, PyTorch, and TensorFlow).
							
							Throughout my journey, I’ve woven my skills into captivating projects, each serving as a testament to my unwavering commitment to transforming data into actionable insights. My work reflects my integrity, serving as my signature—a promise that I approach every task with an open heart, ready to make a meaningful impact.
							
							Above all, I derive joy from helping others—whether through my analytical prowess or simply by being a friend. The essence of who I am is intertwined with the idea that my journey is not solely mine; it’s a shared experience with every person I encounter.
							
							Let’s embark on this data-driven journey together.<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/okafor-chibuzor-17832a225/">        Okafor Chibuzor</a>.</p>

									<p>
										This project focuses on developing and comparing two image classification models using Keras for the specific task of identifying cracks in concrete surfaces. The dataset (<a href="https://s3-api.us-geo.objectstorage.softlayer.net/cf-courses-data/CognitiveClass/DL0321EN/data/concrete_data_week4.zip">Click here to Download</a>) consists of images of concrete, where the objective is to classify each image as either positive (cracked) or negative (not cracked).

										The first model utilizes the VGG16 pre-trained model, which has been pre-trained on large-scale image datasets. The second model is was loaded as it has been built in a previous project, RESNET50 is known for its depth and effectiveness in feature extraction.

										Both models are trained and fine-tuned using the concrete image dataset, with the aim of accurately distinguishing between cracked and non-cracked concrete surfaces. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are employed to assess the performance of each model.

										By comparing the performance of the VGG16 and RESNET50 models, this project aims to determine which architecture is more effective for the task of concrete crack detection. The insights gained from this comparative analysis can inform future efforts in developing image classification systems for detecting cracks in concrete structures.</p>
